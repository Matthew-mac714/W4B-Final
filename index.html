    <h2>10 Fun Halloween Facts You Didn't Know
    
    
        Halloween is here, the time for pumpkin carving and trick-or-treating children. Since you are about to find out about Halloween,why is Halloween spooky, the origin of Halloween, and other questions that pop up in your mind?

    
        The Name 'Halloween' Is Derived From 'Holy Evening.' 
    
            Although you have been celebrating the event for years, did you know that Halloween is an abbreviation? We have unwound the fact for you. Also referred to as the All-Saints' Eve, the name Halloween has come from the Scottish term 'All-Hallows Eve.' 
    
    
        Halloween Has Its Roots In Ancient Celtic   Celebrations
    
            It is believed that Halloween originated from the old harvest festival of Samhain by the Celtic people. They thought evil spirits returned to their homes at night and lit bonfires to fend them away. Also, they disguised themselves, i.e., wore masks and costumes not to be recognized by the evil wandering spirits. While the heart's spirits warded off, the ancestors were welcomed home. A bonfire would start with the murdered animals' bones, and food was made for the life and the dead. 
     
    
    
        "Jack-O'-Lantern" Originates From Irish Stingy Jack And Not Pumpkins. 
        
            The most famous image you associate with Halloween is undoubtedly the jack-o'-lantern. Traditionally, it is made up of pumpkin carving and lighting it up from the inside (creepy, right?). However, the story is different in reality, and the first jack-o-lantern was carved out of turnips. Jack-o-lanterns are named after Jack, an Irish legend who convinced the devil to turn into a coin. 
    

    
        Trick-Or-Treating Started From 'Souling.

            Do you see children knocking from door to door searching for treats and candies on Halloween? You do, of course, since it is the most popular Halloween event. The tradition, however, roots back in the customs of Samhain. Here's the real story behind it; souling grew wide as the Catholic Church replaced pagan festivities, where underprivileged people visited homes dressed up as evil spirits to accept food in exchange for prayers. 
    
    
        Some Halloween Rituals For Finding A Husband
    
            Well, it sounds a little extra, but yes, the Halloween occasion was perfect for single ladies to find their romantic match. Women used to throw apple peels on their shoulders to see their future husband's initials in the pattern. And when they bobbed for apples, the winner would marry first. Sometimes they also stand in a dark room, holding a candle in front of a mirror to see their husband's face in the mirror.

            Many Halloween-obsessed personalities would argue that candy corn tastes like chicken feed, but that's not the reason behind its original name. George Renninger gave the original word and sold it to the Jelly Belly Co. The story behind its chicken feed name is that we used to feed chickens, and that creation was called "chicken feed."

        How Halloween Is Celebrated Today
    
    
            Driven from ancient Celtic cultures and religious festivities, the holiday of Halloween is still enthusiastically celebrated in most parts of the world. Particularly in countries like the US, UK, Mexico, and Ireland, people commemorate the day energetically. However, the festivities of Halloween could not reach across the Atlantic since the Puritans refused to accept the pagan roots. 
    
        Regardless, Halloween made its way to most parts of the globe and is widely celebrated on October 31. On All Hallow's Eve, candy-loving people honor the ancient festivities and the old traditions. They dress up in different spooky costumes, carve pumpkins, carry out bonfires, fortune-telling, and other activities, but predominantly for fun now. 
    
        The day also marks the end of the harvest or the beginning of the new year for Wiccans. It is also believed that this time of the year is when the boundary between this world and the supernatural world is the thinnest, allowing easy access for ghosts, the devil to step in, and the evil spirits to return to their homes. For this reason, Halloween is believed to be the potential time for forecasting the future. However, Halloween has changed form and modernized with time. From solely practicing religious rituals to enjoying quality time with loved ones, the occasion has come a long way. Modern celebrations of Halloween, though, incorporate old traditions yet have transformed it into a fun event, gathering neighbors and loved ones and giving them gifts. 
    
        Although the main events that reflect the true essence of Halloween include trick-or-treating, costume parties, and spooky yet fun games, in parts of the world other than the US, bonfires, and fireworks are also chief components of the day. After the children are done trick-or-treating, they visit their neighbors and loved ones for Halloween and costume parties. There, they play apple-bobbing and card games to enjoy the feast. In Latin America, the celebration is based mainly on the honor of the dead that are believed to return to their homes. Many families create an altar for the ones who have passed and fill them with treats, flowers, and the person's favorite beverages. 
    
        Final Thoughts
            
            Today, Americans and other people around the globe all celebrate Halloween joyously. Officially known to have started in the 8th century, the event still holds great significance. However, when it comes to thehistory of Halloween, Halloween history has been forgotten by many, most of whom never found it out in the first place. At present, the event is more like a chance to trick-or-treat children and wear spooky costumes to frighten the people close to the heart (as a joke). Originated as a spooky event, it is now full of fun and mischief, thanks to the people who kept the tradition going!  </h2>
